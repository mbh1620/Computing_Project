How this project works

The executable gets made and then when the executable is run the .html file is created the render.html is where the model gets rendered.


CMake has now been added

To build and run:

use cmake in /computing project
then make 

The build files need to be in the same directory as the input and output files otherwise it will not work.

Also to run the executable, it needs to be run from the command line.

Then to run the gui click on "render.html"
