Naming of Directories: 


All directories containing classes should be named with the class name, an underscore and then 'class' such as:

```
"className_class"
```

All directories containing non-class items should be named with spaces such as:

```
"Non-class Directory" 
```

This should help with including classes into code and stop confusion.
